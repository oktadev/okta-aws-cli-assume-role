#Okta AWS-CLI Tool

This readme file is an excerpt of the [Okta-AWS Integration Guide](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Amazon-Web-Services-and-Okta-Integration-Guide). We highly recommend that you first read it to understand how Okta and AWS integrate with each other.

Important Note: This tool has been verified to work on Mac OS X El Capitan and Windows Server 2012 R2 and is expected to work on Linux and Unix as well.

###AWS:reInvent Release (2016/11/29 update)
####The Okta AWS-CLI tool finally supports multi-policy cross-account roles!
You can now use this tool with the cross-account role architecture recommended in the [Okta-AWS Integration Guide](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Amazon-Web-Services-and-Okta-Integration-Guide), i.e. you can assign multiple AssumeRole policies to a single cross-account role.

#####Important note
The AWS-CLI tool currently only supports single-statement policies, i.e. policies with one single AssumeRole action (pointing to a role in a separate account). Additionally, the tool only supports managed policies. Support for inline policies is planned in the near future.


The Okta AWS-CLI Tool allows Okta customers to take advantage of [Okta](www.okta.com) to use the [AWS Command Line Interface](https://aws.amazon.com/cli) without relying on permanent AWS keys. More specifically, it allows them to generate temporary 60-minute keys
that are stored for each profile in the ```~/.aws/credentials``` file. Additionally, if the AWS environment is leveraging cross-account roles and the AssumeRole AWS function, the tool will be able to detect that you choose
to assume a cross-account role and will be able to extract the actual role in the target account as well as add an additional profile line the ```~/.aws/config``` file.

__Important note__: please note that this tool only supports Okta MFA set up at the organization level (i.e. not at the sign-on policy level).

##Setup

- Use ```git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role.git``` to clone the repository locally.
- In Terminal, run ```defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES``` if you want to be able to inspect the ```~/.aws/credentials``` and ```~/.aws/config``` files.

##Compiling the application
The application was built and compiled with [JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The instructions below explain how to compile the application using IntelliJ IDEA or directly with maven.

###Prerequisites
First of all, it goes without saying that you will need to install the [Java SE 8x](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or the [Java JDK 8x](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).

###Building with maven
To compile and package the application, use maven:

```
mvn clean package
```

This will produce a shaded jar with all the required dependencies that can be executed on its own.

###Opening the project with IntelliJ Idea

- Open the IntelliJ Idea IDE and browse to the ```okta-aws-cli-assume-role``` folder you have cloned from GitHub inside the ```Projects``` folder.
- Go to ```File => Project Structure``` and in the Libraries menu, fix the Java references that don't match your local setup.
- Go to ```Build => Make Project``` in order to compile the project.
- The project also builds the JAR artifact, so if you browse to the ```target``` sub-folder, you will see the ```okta-aws-cli-<version>.jar``` JAR artifact.

##Configuring AWS IAM

  Because this tool aims at facilitating your interaction with the AWS CLI, it must be able to look into the role you select to assume in order to figure out whether it's a role with direct permissions on the account, or a cross-account role that allows you to assume a role (with real permissions) in another account. To perform this introspection into the AWS roles, the tool must be granted AIM Read Only Access in AWS so that it can automatically add the proper role_arn and source_profile entries into the AWS config file.

In order to generate the key and secret to be configured in the ```config.properties``` file, please follow the steps highlighted in ```Appendix A: How to create a IAM user for role introspection``` in the [Okta-AWS Integration Guide](https://support.okta.com/help/articles/Knowledge_Article/Amazon-Web-Services-and-Okta-Integration-Guide) 

##Configuring the application
  It is essential that ```config.properties``` is in the working directory or that ```.okta-aws.properties``` is in the user home directory (either file will be read). The ```config.properties``` config file holds information specific to each Okta organization (or "tenant") and needs to be configured on an org to org basis.
  
Here is the list of parameters that must be maintained in the ```config.properties``` file:
  
  - ```OKTA_ORG``` which is the url of your Okta org (starting with https://).
  - ```OKTA_AWS_APP_URL``` is the url link of your Okta AWS application url (see below for more info)
  - ```AWS_IAM_KEY```: paste the ```Access Key ID``` value you retrieved in the  previous section 
  -  ```AWS_IAM_SECRET```: paste the ```Secret Access Key``` value you retrieved in the previous section 
    
  - **Obtaining the AWS app url**
    - Navigate to the ```Admin Dashboard``` of you Okta organization
    - Select the ```Applications``` tab and click on your AWS Application 
    - Under the ```General``` menu, scroll down to find the ```App Embed Link``` section 
    - Your link is located under ```EMBED LINK``` 
  - Replace the example values in ```config.properties``` with your values

##Running the application
  - To run the application, you can use the ```awscli.bat``` file (windows) or ```awscli.sh``` file (linux / osx).
  - The default command is the following: ```java -jar target/okta-aws-cli-<version>.jar```
