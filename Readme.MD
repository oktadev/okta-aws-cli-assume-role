## Installation

### Windows

1. Run the following in a [PowerShell console](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831491.aspx#start-windows-powershell)
    ```pwsh
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy unrestricted -Force; Invoke-Expression ((New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role/master/bin/Install-OktaAwsCli.ps1')); .$profile
    ```
2. Customize **%userprofile%\\.okta\\config.properties** and set **OKTA_ORG** and **OKTA_AWS_APP_URL** appropriately. For example,
   ```properties
   OKTA_ORG=acmecorp.oktapreview.com
   OKTA_AWS_APP_URL=https://acmecorp.oktapreview.com/home/amazon_aws/0oa5zrwfs815KJmVF0h7/137
   ```

### macOS/Linux

1. Run the following in a Terminal, optionally setting a custom
   `PREFIX` value (default: `~/.okta`):

    ```bash
    PREFIX=~/.okta bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role/master/bin/install.sh) -i
    ```

2. Customize **~/.okta/config.properties** and set **OKTA_ORG** and **OKTA_AWS_APP_URL** appropriately. For example,
   
   ```properties
   OKTA_ORG=acmecorp.oktapreview.com
   OKTA_AWS_APP_URL=https://acmecorp.oktapreview.com/home/amazon_aws/0oa5zrwfs815KJmVF0h7/137
   ```
3. Make sure **/usr/local/bin** (or whatever $PREFIX/bin is) is in your PATH

### Docker

1. Create `~/.okta/config.properties` and set **OKTA_ORG** and **OKTA_AWS_APP_URL** appropriately. For example,
   
   ```properties
   OKTA_ORG=acmecorp.oktapreview.com
   OKTA_AWS_APP_URL=https://acmecorp.oktapreview.com/home/amazon_aws/0oa5zrwfs815KJmVF0h7/137
   ```
2. Run this command:
   ```shell
   docker run -v ~/.okta/config.properties:/root/.okta/config.properties -it tomsmithokta/okta-awscli-java
   ```

Read more at [@tom-smith-okta's okta-awscli-java Docker repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/tomsmithokta/okta-awscli-java/).

### Manual install

Create a `.okta` directory in your home directory. For example, `~/.okta`.

Download the latest release JAR and put it in `.okta`:
https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role/releases

Create `~/.okta/config.properties` and set
**OKTA_ORG** and **OKTA_AWS_APP_URL** appropriately. For example,

```properties
OKTA_ORG=acmecorp.oktapreview.com
OKTA_AWS_APP_URL=https://acmecorp.oktapreview.com/home/amazon_aws/0oa5zrwfs815KJmVF0h7/137
```

Create `~/.okta/logging.properties` with the following content,

```properties
com.amazonaws.auth.profile.internal.BasicProfileConfigLoader = NONE
```

Copy scripts from `.okta/bin` to somewhere on your PATH.

## Usage

Verify your setup with a simple command:

```bash
okta-aws test sts get-caller-identity
```

This will prompt for Okta credentials, log you into AWS, let you pick a role, and store a session profile called **test** for you.

Run the program again to see session resumption (you won't be asked for Okta credentials until the session expires):

```bash
okta-aws test sts get-caller-identity
```

NOTE: **okta-aws** is a function loaded from your shell profile, not a typical program or command stored in a file.

NOTE: On a *nix platform the `withokta` wrapper script will attempt to parse `$https_proxy` as a URI. If successful the host and port values will be passed to the JVM. User credentials in the proxy configuration are not currently used. This allows the `okta-aws` tool to be used in an environment where internet access for the servers is mediate via a proxy, e.g an EC2 instance inside a restricted VPC.

The proxy URI _must_ be of the form `http://host:port/`. Both the host and port are mandatory.

## Compiling the application

The application was built and compiled with [JetBrains' IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). Note that you don't have to compile the application in order to be able to execute it, since the compiled executable (a JAR file) is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role/releases).

### Prerequisites
First of all, it goes without saying that you will need to install the [Java SE 11x](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or the [Java JDK 11x](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk11-downloads-5066655.html).

Then you will need [Maven 2 or later](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) to run the build.

### Building on the command line

Get a single JAR with all dependencies:

Use ```git clone https://github.com/oktadeveloper/okta-aws-cli-assume-role.git``` to clone the repository locally. Then, build with Maven:

```bash
mvn package
cp target/okta-aws-cli-*.jar ~/.okta/okta-aws-cli.jar
```

## Configuring AWS in Okta

[Integrating the Amazon Web Services Command Line Interface Using Okta](https://support.okta.com/help/Documentation/Knowledge_Article/Integrating-the-Amazon-Web-Services-Command-Line-Interface-Using-Okta). 

## Configuring the application
Here is the list of parameters that can be environment variables or settings in the ```~/.okta/config.properties``` file:
  
  - ```OKTA_ORG``` which is the url of your Okta org (starting with https://).
  - ```OKTA_AWS_APP_URL``` is the url link of your Okta AWS application url (see below for more info) 
  - ```OKTA_USERNAME``` is the username to use. If present will skip username input.
  - ```OKTA_PASSWORD_CMD``` is the command to fetch your password instead of showing a password prompt. [Read more...](docs/OKTA_PASSWORD_CMD.md)
  - ```OKTA_ENV_MODE``` set to **true** to run sub-command with **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID**, **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY**, and **AWS_SESSION_TOKEN** env vars set. Temporary credentials are shared in memory and kept off disk in this mode. (default: **false**)
  - ```OKTA_BROWSER_AUTH``` set to **true** to use integrated web browser for authentication (default: **false**)
  - ```OKTA_COOKIES_PATH``` is directory path to store cookies.properties for Okta. This is particularly useful when running this tool in many concurrent processes like you might with **OKTA_ENV_MODE** (default: ~/.okta)
  - ```OKTA_PROFILE``` is the name of the AWS profile to create/reuse.  May also be specified on the commandline by ```--profile```. (default: get AWS profile name based on per-session STS user name)  
  - ```OKTA_AWS_REGION``` is the default AWS region to store with the created profile.
  - ```OKTA_AWS_ROLE_TO_ASSUME``` is the IAM Role ARN to use. If present will try to match okta account's retrieved role list and use it. Will still prompt if no match found. (ex: **arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EC2-Admins**)
  - ```OKTA_STS_DURATION``` is the duration the role will be assumed, in seconds. The maximum session duration allowed by AWS is 12 hours and this needs to be set on the role as well.  Defaults to 1hr.
  - ```OKTA_MFA_CHOICE``` is the provider and factor type to use if prompted for MFA.  Example: ```OKTA.push```. See [Factors documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/factors#factor-type) for values. (default: use single factor or prompt user to select from usable factors).
  
  - **Obtaining the AWS app url**
    - Navigate to the ```Admin Dashboard``` of you Okta organization
    - Select the ```Applications``` tab and click on your AWS Application 
    - Under the ```General``` menu, scroll down to find the ```App Embed Link``` section 
    - Your link is located under ```EMBED LINK``` 
  - Replace the example values in ```~/.okta/config.properties``` with your values

You can specify configuration overrides for each profile by creating a ```~/.okta/config.{profilename}.properties``` file. The base settings
will be loaded first and the profile-specific settings will be loaded after, allowing you to only override specific settings that need to be different.
For example, if you want the ```prod``` profile to connect to a different Okta org, create a ```~/.okta/config.prod.properties```file and set 
```OKTA_ORG``` to something different.

Note: environment variables take precedence over any config file.

## Troubleshooting

### I get "You have no factors enrolled"

This means that MFA is enforced, but you have no factors enrolled on your user.

You should enrol a CLI-supported factor (all except Duo as far as I know).

If you are using Duo Push, consider setting **OKTA_BROWSER_AUTH=true** in [the configuration](#configuring-the-application).

### I have Duo, but I get "None of your factors are supported"

This means that MFA is enforced, but none of the factors you have enrolled are supported.

Okta's integration with Duo requires an iframe which isn't practical to interact with from a CLI context.
